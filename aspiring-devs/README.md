# aspiring-devs-p1
First project for mentees in the Aspiring Devs group to build.  Don't forget to reach out to your mentors if you get stuck!

## Objectives
1. Create a web app that can display a story and title to the browser.
2. Create an input field where the author can write their name
   - The author for the story hasn't been provided.  Make a textbox or input field where a name can be typed.
   - Add a button that, when clicked, will save the author's name.  The name should persist at least until the refresh button is clicked in the browser.
   - Create a space somewhere near the title where the author's name will show after it's been saved.

The final design is up to you, but the story should be easy to query and easy to read.  You'll find the story pre-written in `src/index.js`.

## Getting Started
To get started, 
1. Clone this repository
   - You'll need git, which can be downloaded here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
      - Install it
   - In your home folder (if you're on Windows, you can use your C: drive), create a `dev` folder, and open it.
   - Open a terminal in this folder and type `git clone https://github.com/ojsung/aspiring-devs-p1.git`
2. Open up `src/App.html` which has been provided to you in this project.  Follow the instructions contained there to install a code editor.
3. Open up this folder (`aspiring-devs-p1`) in your code editor and `src/App.html` in a browser, and start coding
   - To see changes you make in the code editor, you'll have to click "refresh" in the browser (unless you choose to use a javascript framework like Vue or React instead of vanilla javascript)
4. The rest is up to you.  Good luck. We're excited to see what you create.
